# atom2reMarkable

An automated Python application that converts Atom XML feeds into PDF documents and uploads them to reMarkable Cloud. Designed to run as an automated process in GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started

### Authentication

The reMarkable API requires a device token, which can only be created by providing a one-time code generated by the reMarkable website. Once that token is generated, it can be persisted and is used to generate user tokens.

This app expects a `$DEVICE_TOKEN` environment variable to exist, containing the value of that token.

As this project is intended to run in ephemeral containers, we need to generate a token outside of the app and persist it elsewhere. Running it in container action in GitHub Actions gives us access to repository secrets and the ability to pass them as environment variables to the container.

But, first we need to generate the token. For that, there's a helper script provided called `TOKEN_RETRIEVER.sh`. It's a bit of a hack, but one that only needs to be run once.

**Using TOKEN_RETRIEVER.sh**
1. Install the app locally by cloning the repo and following the instructions below.
2. Perform an initial run of `rmapi`.
3. Follow the authentication instructions.
4. Run `./TOKEN_RETRIEVER.sh` in your shell. It will output a token.
5. Create a `DEVICE_TOKEN` repository secret or environment variable and assign it the output of step 4.
   
### Local Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure feeds:**
Edit `feeds.txt` to include your Atom feed URLs (one per line):
```
https://realpython.com/atom.xml
https://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar
https://planet.python.org/rss20.xml
```

3. **Run once:**
```bash
python main.py
```

### Docker Deployment

**Build and run:**
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t atom2remarkable .

# Run with your .env file (contains DEVICE_TOKEN)
docker run --rm --env-file .env atom2remarkable
```

**Or use the provided script:**
```bash
./run.sh
```

**Run with custom parameters:**
```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
  -v "$(pwd)/logs:/app/logs" \
  -e RECENT_HOURS=48 \
  atom2remarkable
```

**Required setup:**
1. Create a `.env` file with your reMarkable device token:
   ```
   DEVICE_TOKEN="your_remarkable_device_token_here"
   ```
2. **Configure feeds:**
Edit `feeds.txt` to include your Atom feed URLs (one per line):
```
https://realpython.com/atom.xml
https://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar
https://planet.python.org/rss20.xml
```
3. Run the container - it will automatically upload PDFs to your reMarkable device

### GitHub Actions Deployment

The application includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Runs daily at 6:00 AM UTC
- Can be triggered manually with custom parameters
- Generates PDFs inside the container
- Automatically uploads to reMarkable Cloud
- Extracts and uploads results as artifacts

**Setup:**
1. Push this repository to GitHub
2. Add your `DEVICE_TOKEN` as a repository secret
3. The workflow is automatically configured in `.github/workflows/atom-feed-processor.yml`
4. PDFs will be uploaded to your reMarkable device and available as downloadable artifacts

**Manual trigger:**
- Go to Actions tab in your GitHub repository
- Select "Atom Feed Processor" workflow
- Click "Run workflow" to process feeds immediately
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
  -v "$(pwd)/logs:/app/logs" \
  atom2remarkable

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `FEEDS_FILE`: Path to feeds list file (default: `feeds.txt`)
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory for generated PDFs (default: `output`)
- `LOG_DIR`: Directory for log files (default: `logs`)
- `RECENT_HOURS`: Hours to look back for recent entries (default: `24`)
- `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: HTTP request timeout in seconds (default: `30`)

### reMarkable Cloud Integration

- `DEVICE_TOKEN`: Your reMarkable device token (required for upload)
- `REMARKABLE_FOLDER`: Folder name in reMarkable Cloud (default: `AtomFeeds`)

### Command Line Options

```bash
python main.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --feeds-file PATH        Override feeds.txt file location
  --output-dir PATH        Override output directory
  --recent-hours INT       Override recent entry window
  --remarkable-folder NAME reMarkable folder name
  --rmapi-path PATH        Path to rmapi binary
```

## Output

### PDF Files

PDFs are organized into subdirectories by feed name, with publication date and article titles as filenames:
```
output/
├── Feed Name 1/
│   ├── MM-DD-YYYY Article Title 1.pdf
│   ├── MM-DD-YYYY Article Title 2.pdf
│   └── MM-DD-YYYY Another Article Title.pdf
└── Feed Name 2/
    ├── MM-DD-YYYY Different Article.pdf
    └── MM-DD-YYYY Some Other Article.pdf
```

Example: `output/Real Python/07-28-2025 Pythons asyncio A Hands-On Walkthrough.pdf`

If duplicate article titles exist within the same feed on the same date, a counter is appended (e.g., `07-30-2025 Article Title.pdf`, `07-30-2025 Article Title 1.pdf`).

### PDF Formatting

PDFs of the Atom feeds are generated using the `arcicle.html` and `style.css` files within the `/templates` directory.

## Testing
